    'description' => '<p>After striking a fruitful partnership with <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/wazdan">Wazdan</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/skillonnet">SkillOnNet</a> didn’t waste any time seeking out new expansion opportunities. Now, the company has agreed to power and license Slingo.com through an exclusive agreement.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>A new gaming supergroup is about to launch online</strong></li>
	<li><strong>SkillOnNet is behind many successful online casino brands</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A new chapter begins for Slingo.com</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Founded in 1994, Slingo.com will now be marketed and operated by SkillOnNet operator Prime Gaming, the brain behind ICE36.com and MegaCasino.com.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“With the coming together of SkillOnNet, Gaming Realms, and Prime Gaming, it feels like we’re putting together an online gaming supergroup,” said Michael Golembo of SkillOnNet.</span><br />
<br />
Gaming Realms, Slingo’s parent company, has launched some of the most well-known products into the gambling market, such as Slingo Rainbow Riches, Slingo Extreme, and Slingo XXXTreme.<br />
<img alt="Slingo logo partnership SKillOnNet Wazdan online casino gaming slots" height="385" heightcpy="385" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Slingo-lg.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="850" widthcpy="850" /><br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What’s the actual deal between SkillOnNet and Slingo.com?</strong></span><br />
The collaboration SkillOnNet and Slingo.com will give users 3,000 new games to choose from, all from some of the top-rated developers in the online casino industry. No original games will disappear from the official Slingo website. There will only be additional ones that will bring more and more players to the Slingo platform.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“SkillOnNet is behind some of the most successful online casino brands in the world and we wanted to leverage its technology and experience to drive Slingo.com forwards,” said Mark Segal, CFO of Gaming Realms.</span><br />
<br />
Licensing offered by SkillOnNet will help Slingo operate in more countries and get its brand known by many more people across the globe. <br />
<br />
SkillOnNet has the intention of providing more and more casino products to gambling enthusiasts out there. Recently, its partnership with Wazdan was a real success, as this was a good way to provide more for passionate gamblers.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“It&#39;s a pleasure to partner with SkillOnNet and release Wazdan games through their brands, including <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/reviews/playojo-casino-review">PlayOJO</a>, SlotsMagic, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/reviews/drueckglueck-casino-review">DrueckGlueck</a> and more. This relationship further expands the reach of our games across the European market,” said Andrzej Hyla, Head of Sales at Wazdan.</span><br />
<br />
This proves the SkillOnNet team’s dedication and good reputation in the online casino gaming industry as the company makes a name for itself by helping smaller providers reach bigger audiences. There surely are many other providers SkillOnNet would like to collaborate with, and users surely can&#39;t wait for the next partnership that is to come!</p>

As illustrated by the images attached above and below, the Leprechaun’s Magic new online slot for 20202 released by Red Tiger Gaming evokes an atmosphere that is particularly jolly and pleasant. You’ll find yourself in the mood to gamble for real money in no time!<br />
<br />
With 10 paylines and an RTP of 95.95%, Red Tiger Gaming’s Leprechaun’s Magic is a penny slot suitable for novices and high rollers alike, as the minimum bet amount is 0.20 EUR and it can get to 10 EUR. All these will surely appeal to the fans of the genre itself, but this slot can surely be played by any passionate player.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>More on Leprechaun’s Magic</strong></span><br />
A well-known theme, the Irish green interface is one that has been used by many slots up to date. However, it can still hit differently depending on the game’s overall design. For fans of the genre, the theme can be a big advantage, and Leprechaun’s Magic is no exception. Even if this concept has been used by many others before it, Red Tiger Gaming managed to revive it and create an entirely special online casino game.<br />
<img alt="Red Tiger Gaming Launches New Leprechaun\'s Magic Slot gameplay irish online casino game new " height="416" heightcpy="416" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Leprechaun_s_Magic_slot.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="740" widthcpy="740" />Leprechaun’s Magic is all about its mighty wins of 5,000 times the stake with one single spin. The Expanding Symbols appear in both bonus and base gameplays. When there is a win, the winning symbol will light up and create a Golden Symbol. If there are 3 or more Golden Symbols these will expand and cover the entire reel, which in turn will generate the winning lines.<br />
<br />
The Magic Spins Free Spins feature will trigger once Pot of Gold scatter symbols appear, with at least 3 in view triggering a spin on the Magic Wheel. During normal base game spins, Golden Symbols only last one spin. <br />
<br />
We are sure players will enjoy this game, thanks to everything it has to offer. The free spins and bonuses are really lucrative and all of the visual effects are on point, which recommends Leprechaun’s Magic as another success from Red Tiger Gaming!</p>

<p><img alt="China Philippine gambling ban" height="512" heightcpy="512" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/China_Philippines.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1024" widthcpy="1024" /><span style="font-size:16px;">"We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary," declared Mr. Martini Cruz, chief of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation’s cybercrime division.</span><br />
<br />
However, the restrictions have not targeted proxy betting, which is allowed in licensed casinos in the Philippines and contributed to a significant rise in VIP revenues. <br />
<br />
Proxy betting implies a gambler outside the casino giving instructions to an agent via an online platform. This allows people to bet anonymously and even illegally.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>The Legal Status of Gambling in China </strong></span><br />
In theory, gambling is illegal according to Chinese law since the Communist Party took power back in 1949. This prohibits all forms of gambling, online or otherwise, but people do have access to land-based gambling in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="color:#e74c3c;">“80% of the business comes from <strong>proxy gambling</strong> and 20% from customers visiting casinos for live table games.”</span></span><br />
<br />
The Chinese government operates the Welfare and Sports Lotteries, which are not considered gambling. However, in Hong Kong, many forms of iGaming are regulated. <br />
<br />
When it comes to Macau, casino games have been legal since the 1850s, as it once was a Portuguese colony. The region is known for the presence of traditional Chinese games in casinos.<br />
<br />
Even though proxy betting is banned in Singapore and Macau, there is a gray legal area in the Philippines. According to leading junket operator Suncity, 80% of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20% from customers visiting casinos for live table games.<br />
<br />
Manila and Hong Kong now fight against illegal gambling in all forms, as Xi Jinping of China and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines join forces against these types of actions. The Philippine president has even gone as far as to make illegal gambling the third worst crime in the country after drugs and corruption.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What the Situation Looks Like</strong></span><br />
After Philippine authorities arrested 342 Chinese workers in December 2019 in a raid on an unlicensed and illegal gambling operation, it is now time for them to join China in this fight against illegal and fraudulent betting. <br />
<img alt="China Philippine gambling ban proxy betting" height="1326" heightcpy="1326" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/China_Philippines_Gambling.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1999" widthcpy="1999" />The situation generated more crimes in China, but the Chinese Embassy said that it “works closely with the Philippines to combat such crimes as telecommunications fraud, illegal online gambling, money laundering, illegal employment, kidnapping, extortion, torture, murder”.<br />
<br />
In 2019, Beijing canceled 800 Chinese passports. This made the people “fugitive” which led to them being arrested by the Philippine authorities.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>More Restrictions Are Coming</strong></span><br />
Even if the authorities are already making visible efforts, it is obvious that the operation has just begun and that it won’t stop until this gambling problem is solved. <br />
<br />
As long as the Chinese and Philippine Governments are trying to combat this type of crime, there is hope that one day people will gamble legally in a safe and licensed environment that abides by each countries’ regulations. <br />
<br />
These illegal betting methods are not safe, nor are they rewarding in any case, and they are also making room for many other criminal actions which the Chinese and Philippine governments want to keep under control.</p>

    'type' => 'news',
    'description' => '<p>Online casino companies operating in Spain are obligated to change their welcome bonus policy, as Spain is facing a problematic situation right now. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Spanish Government decided that welcome bonuses will have a maximum value of €100</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The matter also addresses the underage gambling problem in Spain</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Online gambling lacks sufficient identity validation compared to land-based facilities</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Spain welcome bonuses online casinos" height="664" heightcpy="664" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Spain_Country-min.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1000" widthcpy="1000" />The aforementioned mandatory policy changes come with a growing intention on the part of Spanish officials to decrease illegal gambling rates, especially among underage and chronically-ill players. These new restrictions will be part of the <strong>Royal Decree Project</strong>, which focuses on how gambling companies are allowed to market their products to the general public.<br />
<br />
While welcome bonuses are not necessarily problematic in their nature, the whole situation degenerated when underaged gamblers made use of them in order to play illegally and for free.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>The Latest Rules Implemented In Spain</strong></span><br />
The Spanish Government has decided to stop underage gambling in the country after observing that many minors abused the demo feature of welcome bonuses, thus resulting in illegal gambling. This means that new restrictions are coming in order for the law to be respected by that particular group of players that should not be gambling in the first place.<br />
<br />
Jdigital, Spanish’s dedicated authority that deals with online gambling, mentioned that last month its members started imposing the new voluntary advertising code that limits welcome bonuses to €200. This, of course, does not include the amount players can obtain through ads or other kinds of offers that also stack with the initial money. <br />
<br />
Therefore, this method did not work as it should and players continued making significant wins by playing for free. <br />
<img alt="Spain welcome bonuses" height="300" heightcpy="300" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Welcome_Bonus.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="600" widthcpy="600" />Problem gambling is rumoured to be a big issue in Spain, as there is a high-rate of underage players. However, the official statistics for problem gamblers is somewhere around 0.4%. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“Police forces do not relate any major social problems to gambling in the region.” - Javier Molinera, head of National Police Gaming and Betting Control Service.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What About the Spanish Government?</strong></span><br />
The government announced EFICAZ, the operational system meant to limit problematic and addicted gamblers from accessing various forms of financing to play. This was designed as a self-exclusion program.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">Alberto Garzón, Spain’s Minister of Consumer Affairs, declared that the type of customers attracted by online casinos had “proved to be controversial”, especially due to “expanding the number of users and amounts played”.</span><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the mentioned statistics also involve minors and gambling addicts, which are exactly the type of at-risk categories who need to stop playing casino games.<br />
<br />
This may be the main reason these restrictions needed to be applied,  namely to protect the people who need it the most. Another beneficial side effect for the online gambling industry would be to prevent excessive playing with free money.<br />
<br />
In other words, Spain has come to the right decision, helping its citizens along the way and shedding light on a problem that may happen to anyone. Considering the <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/news/the-united-kingdom-prohibited-credit-cards-for-online-gambling">regulations imposed in the United Kingdom regarding credit cards</a>, it is clear that there may be many other countries that face the problem of fraudulent gambling, as sometimes people abuse bonuses and advantages.<br />
<br />
As a conclusion, the government and specialists in Spain have restricted welcome bonuses in online casinos to €100, so that users will be able to benefit from some free money but also gamble with their own. </p>

	<li><strong>22% of gamblers using credit cards are classified as “problematic” in the UK</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Authorities speak of gambling addiction as of a mental health crisis</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Some gamblers from the UK are in substantial debt, placing bets of £380,000 per session</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to industry regulators, using a credit card as a payment method for online casinos in the United Kingdom will be banned due at the suggestion of <strong>The Department of Culture</strong>, <strong>Media</strong>, <strong>and</strong> <strong>Sport (DCMS)</strong>. All gambling in the UK will be all affected by this ban, except for the <strong>National</strong> <strong>Lottery</strong>.<br />
<br />
The restriction will come into effect starting with the 14th of April. This has been decided due to the fact that many people are gambling with money they don’t have, resulting in the country’s national economy being affected.<br />
<img alt="UK gambling credit cards ban big ben london" height="334" heightcpy="334" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/ukk.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="500" widthcpy="500" /><span style="font-size:16px;">“Credit Card gambling can lead to significant financial harm”, says Neil McArthur, Gambling Commission chief executive.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Gamblers in the United Kingdom Are in Debt</strong></span><br />
The United Kingdom wants to protect its citizens, especially those who suffer from an online gambling addiction. The <strong>DCMS</strong>, along with <strong>The UK Gambling Commission’s Betting and Gaming Council</strong>, and other relevant authorities have come upon the decision to restrict credit cards, e-wallets, PayPal, and other similar payment methods. <br />
<br />
Statistics show that more than a quarter of online gamblers using a credit card has had a serious online casino addiction problem at least once. In fact, <strong>around 800,000 gamblers use credit cards, and 22% of them are classified as “problem gamblers”</strong> who are prone to developing addictive behaviors.<br />
<br />
Last year, The Guardian reported the case of an addicted gambler who has used nine different credit cards for online gambling and ended up with a <strong>£54,000</strong> overnight loss. Her total bets got to <strong>£380,000</strong> on one website in a single session.<br />
<br />
Gambling enthusiasts will thus be allowed to use debit cards only but with the condition to get a membership for GamStop. GamStop allows gamblers to block their accounts and funds with ease in the case of addictive gambling, and won’t let them open new accounts due to the use of pseudonym recognition technology.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">Claire Murdoch, <strong>National Mental Health Director</strong> with <strong>NHS England</strong>, said “I have seen first-hand the devastating impact on mental wellbeing of addiction and am concerned that the prevalence of gambling in our society is causing harm”, implying that addiction is clearly linked to one’s mental health.</span><br />
<img alt="UK credit card ban casino " height="334" heightcpy="334" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/uk.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="500" widthcpy="500" /><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Other Payment Methods Will Be Restricted Too</strong></span><br />
Brigid Simmonds, the chairwoman of the <strong>Betting and Gaming Council</strong> said that "We will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk”, which means that the Council’s efforts will potentially discover a more suitable way to help those affected by addiction control their habits more successfully.<br />
