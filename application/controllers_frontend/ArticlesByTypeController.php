    'description' => '<p>There are many online casino banking methods to choose from in the online gambling industry. You can rely on your bank via debit cards or a wire transfer, or you can try an intermediate software for quicker transactions and some additional layers of security. It is all up to you! Below, we here at CasinosLists.com have made a selection of the 7 most well-known and player-appreciated online casino payment methods for you to choose from. <br />
<br />
Of course, these options and clearly not the only ones out there, but they are secure, popular, and won’t charge you double the deposit you are willing to make. So, if you want to find out which they are, then keep on reading!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>7. WIRE TRANSFER</strong></span><br />
The simplest method of transferring a certain amount of money from one bank to another, the <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/banking/wire-transfer">wire bank transfer</a> is available for both online casino deposits and withdrawals. It is one of the oldest and most reliable payment options for gambling, as it does not imply any additional intermediates. The only big downside is the effort on your part in terms of obtaining the bank details of the online casino. What is more, wire transfer can also be quite expensive in some countries due to fees charged by both parties involved. <br />
<br />
Therefore, before pursuing a wire bank transfer, you need to ensure that you are well informed on the topic. Still, once you have the details you need, it is a fairly hassle-free procedure, so it might be worth trying out.<br />
<img alt="wire bank transfer online casinos" height="768" heightcpy="768" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Wire_Transfer.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1024" widthcpy="1024" /><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>6. ECOPAYZ</strong></span><br />

Ecopayz accepts €EUR, £GBP, and $USD as currencies. <br />

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>4. BITCOIN</strong></span><br />
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer anonymous cryptocurrency. As a result of mining, its information operates through wallets known as <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/banking/bitcoin">Bitcoin Wallets</a>. Bitcoin offers additional security, considering it is not a part of a bank or controlled by any third parties. The transactions are direct and do not require any additional steps. In order to obtain Bitcoin, you have to access specialty websites, but the procedure isn’t too complicated.

This implies that you have to obtain said card from your bank of choice. When talking Visa and Mastercard, it’s important to mention that each one of them has its local partners in most countries around the world. Thus, you should have no trouble at all finding a bank to issue you this type of card in your area. Just remember that you need to provide private information and consider the adjacent fees of any transaction in order to deposit and withdraw funds via a credit or debit card.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/news/the-united-kingdom-prohibited-credit-cards-for-online-gambling">The UK banned credit cards for gambling purposes</a>, and you can read all about it in our dedicated News section. This means that users from England can no longer transfer funds in this way while playing online casino games.<br />

PAYPAL</strong></span><br />

</center>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>1. SKRILL</strong></span><br />

Of course, it was paid by Steve Wynn, the owner, as he couldn’t let Prince Harry spend a penny. </p>

<p>When it comes to boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr., it is rumoured that his bets can get to $100,000 per hand, and his social media photos showing his wins are proof of that. He is especially a sports betting fan and his bets usually range from $25,000 to even $400,000 on some events. Let’s also not forget that Floyd is the one 50 Cent once put a bet on, and we will get to that as well in a few minutes. However, this is understandable, as Floyd, who came out as a winner and thus earned the rapper a handsome prize, once said:</p>

<p><em>“I land a higher percentage of punches than any boxer in boxing.” - Floyd Mayweather Jr.</em></p>

</center>

<p>It all started when Paris was paid £100,000 for being a DJ at the start of the 2000s somewhere in Vegas. She managed to bet and turn this fee into half a million dollars, but she lost the lot a few hours later. However, her heart remained in Vegas, and in 2012 she tweeted a picture of a $30,000 win on her birthday. Of course, we will never know about the other wins she isn’t sharing on social media. In the hotel heiress’ own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em> “I&#39;m obsessed with poker. It&#39;s my favorite game now. I&#39;m lucky in Vegas. I always win.” - Paris Hilton</em></p>

</center>

<p>The six-time NBA champion just loves wagering, even when it involves losing sometimes. However, Michael Jordan has a really vast history with gambling for fun, and his two sons as well. For Michael Jordan it is all about sports betting, as the competitiveness in the basketball world has made him all he is today. According to the reports, Michael has once bet $300,000 on a hole in one for a golf match.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Gambling is legal and betting is legal, for what I bet.”  - Michael Jordan</em></p>

<p>50 Cent’s passion for sports betting is already well-known, as he once placed a $2 million bet on Floyd Mayweather at a boxing championship. He showed all of his followers how a $500,000 win in cash looks like when he wagered at the NFC Championship, a classic and completely understandable winner move in our book. </p>

<p>After land based casinos came the online ones that allow us to play anywhere, even from a <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/casinos/mobile">mobile</a> device. As technology progresses and our visions change, we all start craving new experiences along with high quality graphics, exciting new concepts, and state of the art features. So, what if we told you that you can now achieve a first-person casino experience in your own home? <br />
<br />
This is where virtual reality comes in. As a history lesson, it all started in Renaissance Europe, where the term of <strong>perspective</strong> was created, meant to define a concept of “multiplying” the “artificial world”. The idea of virtual reality started circulating shortly thereafter, especially in SF novels and movies. However, VR took its official start with Sensorama, the first version of a VR set created in 1962 by Morton Heilig. <br />
<br />
But how does this apply to gambling? Well, if you ever heard about VR online casinos, you may be familiar with the subject. It all boils down to a <strong>virtual</strong> <strong>reality</strong> <strong>kit</strong> that helps you engage with a land based casino with only a few technical requirements on your part. Keep reading to find out more!<br />
<img alt="VR casinos virtual reality vr set casino slots roulette baccarat blackjack virtual reality oculus" height="667" heightcpy="667" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/image3.png" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1000" widthcpy="1000" /></p>

<p><span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>ABOUT VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) </strong></span></span><br />
Virtual reality, or VR for short, is a simulated experience based on the real world meant to digitally transport you to a certain place, film, or even game. It consists of computer-made 360° pictures, places, and videos or even 360° landscapes of real places, depending on what you choose to do. The ability to interact with different objects in VR is the result of multi-projected technologies used to create the images, sensations, and sounds. <br />
<br />
When it comes to virtual reality in the online casinos world, the results of this technology are the ability to spin <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/classic-slots">slots</a> or bet at <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/blackjack">blackjack</a>, which can all be done with VR equipment such as headsets and sometimes even motion controllers. The latter are a pair of devices you hold in your hand in order to interact with the virtual world you are in. These recognize your hand movements and help you feel the whole experience on another level.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>THE FIRST VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) CASINO</strong></span></span><br />
The first virtual reality casino to launch in the industry was <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/reviews/slotsmillion-casino-review">SlotsMillion</a> and, to this day, it is the number one in its area of operation. Inspired by video games, a Malta-based company by the name of ALEA Gaming started the project for SlotsMillion in 2015, and launched it two years later, in 2017. <br />
<br />
The famed casino now offers more than 1,100 <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/classic-slots">slot machines</a> and is known for making the first ever virtual reality casino games available on the market, and thus offering its clients the experience of playing at a real land-based casino. At SlotsMillion, you will find hi-tech games under the brand of some famous names such as <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/netent">NetEnt</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/betsoft">BetSoft</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/blueprint-gaming">Blueprint Gaming</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/saucify">Saucify</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/nextgen-gaming">NextGen Gaming</a>, along with many more. <img alt="SlotsMillion vr online casino virtual reality slots blackjack roulette" height="720" heightcpy="720" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/image2.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1200" widthcpy="1200" />Thanks to SlotsMillion’s ascent, today it is one of the most accessed and played online casinos, thanks to its quality and what it offers. Of course, there is also the fun branch: Oculus’ VR Casino, a social gaming concept that can not be played for real money. As presented below, here you will find online casino games that can be played with free credits, solo or multiplayer. The idea is based on entertainment only and it is dedicated to people who don’t necessarily want to gamble on VR yet, as this will help anyone get used to it and form an idea of what these casinos are all about.</p>

<p><span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>MOBILE COMPATIBILITY</strong></span></span><br />
VR had a blast on mobile in its first years, as Samsung devices could be connected to Oculus and with the help of your smartphone you could enjoy a simulated reality with the help of the corresponding headsets. When Samsung S7 was released, the first orders came with a pair of Oculus glasses with which many games could be played. Today, many online casinos support <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/casinos/mobile">mobile</a> phones when it comes to VR gameplay.  Also, with a smart TV or a compatible Playstation you can find and improvise many ways to play online casino games in VR. It is all up to you and your ideas!<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS</strong></span></span><br />
VR was a science-fiction term until recently, just like FaceTime seemed impossible to have at your own comfort at the start of the 2000s. Today, VR is just another way to play games or watch movies, as we just started the new decade with a huge boom in terms of technology and discoveries. The virtual reality experience is worth trying, especially in online casinos, as it will offer you a totally different feeling than a classic computer or mobile device. Virtual reality casinos are growing in number, as SlotsMillion created a legacy and an evolution in its own niche. Thus, the whole VR casino concept is worth trying, as it is evolving everyday in order to give you the best and most rewarding gameplay out there!</p>

<p><strong>2. THE MASK OF ZORRO (KA GAMING)</strong><br />

<p><strong>1. THE MUMMY (PLAYTECH)<br />
Date of release:</strong> 15 June 2012<br />
<br />
Yet another <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/playtech">Playtech</a> Flash product, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/play/the-mummy-by-playtech">The Mummy</a> may be one of the developer’s biggest successes, just like the movie it takes inspiration from. This slot’s main feature consists of the <strong>Lost City Adventure Bonus</strong> which is activated randomly. A part of the movie will start playing as you are taken to a secret room in the Lost City. You will then have the possibility to pick 6 crates and reveal their prizes which can reach up to 4x your total stake. <br />
<br />
Other attributes of The Mummy that put it in the first position on our top consist of the <strong>Scorpion</strong> <strong>Scatter</strong>, which transforms into an extra scatter, thus giving you more money, and the <strong>Expanding</strong> <strong>Mummy</strong> that turns into an <strong>Expanding</strong> <strong>Wild</strong> in order to cover an entire reel once a wild appears. There is also the <strong>Scarab</strong> <strong>Attack</strong> feature which is activated if wild symbols show on the third reel, and once this occurs you will get two more wilds on reels 2 and 4. With <strong>Mummy</strong> <strong>Power</strong>, each wild multiplies the bet per line by 3 and this feature stacks best with multiple wilds. During <strong>Collapsing</strong> <strong>Reels</strong>, lucky symbols disappear in order to be replaced by new ones over and over, and there is also the <strong>Mummy</strong> <strong>Respin</strong>, where a wild will cause the reel to freeze while the other spin a few more times until a win is triggered.<br />
<br />
The Mummy slot machine by Playtech features a RTP of 92.02% and a minimum bet of 1.25, so that means that it suits experienced players and that you should try it for fun on our website before deciding to gamble at a <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/casinos">real money casino</a>. As any Playtech product, The Mummy should work fine on any mobile device, though it is not mentioned.<br />

When it comes to online casino games, the stakes are most of the time at the highest level. In this article, we will talk about the biggest stakes - to be exact, the top 5 biggest online jackpot wins in history. Imagine living a life crammed luxury that you can afford anything and you pretty much got less than half of what those wins consist of!!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><font face="roboto condensed" size="5"><strong>BIGGEST 5 JACKPOT WINS IN HISTORY</strong></font> </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><font face="roboto condensed" size="5">#5 - NetEnt’s Mega Fortune - €11.736.375</font></span></p>

<p>The first stop in our journey is the “Mega Fortune” slot game’s jackpot that was won in September 2011. Mega Fortune is a game developed by <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/netent">NetEnt</a> which awarded a lucky 20-year old player from Norway an amount of €11.736.375. The jackpot was won in Betsson Casino and was recorded by Guinness later that year. </p>

<p>This amount of money is enough to change the snow of Norway with the sands of Carribean - although we don’t know what the player decided to do, but we can dream of what we would have done in this place, right?<br />
<br />
<img alt="Mega Fortune NetEnt Casino Jackpot" height="1039" heightcpy="1039" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/image4 (1).jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1442" widthcpy="1442" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><font face="roboto condensed" size="5">#4 - Microgaming’s Mega Moolah - €13,328,028.16</font></span></p>

<p>2019 started out great for a lucky player in the Zodiac Casino. Topping up your account with €13,328,028.16 at the beginning of the year would not only change any New Year Resolutions but would entirely reshape anyone’s life. Mega Moolah set up a new milestone for <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/microgaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microgaming</a>’s “millionaire-making” slot, adding up to a total of over €1 billion payments granted to players. <br />
<br />
Microgaming made no less than 68 players millionaires, thanks to its progressive jackpot network. If you would like to know more about Microgaming’s progressive slots network, we recommend the following article which states that it paid out <a href="https://www.microgaming.co.uk/News/Microgamings-progressive-jackpot-network-pays-out-over-89m-euro" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over €89 million in the first half of 2019</a>.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><font face="roboto condensed" size="5">#3 - NetEnt’s Mega Fortune - €17,861,800</font></span></p>

<p>No, it’s not a mistake. Actually, the whole list is a tennis game between NetEnt’s Mega Fortune and Microgaming’s Mega Moolah, which are racing each other for the title of biggest jackpot awarded to a player. Competition is never a bad thing, as the players are getting the payouts - both literally and figuratively. <br />
<br />
It seems that the jackpots from Mega Fortune always head up north - as the fabulous amount of €17,861,800 was won by a 40-years-old Finnish man in January 2013. The happy event happened in the Paf online casino and it was recorded in the news section on <a href="https://www.netent.com/en/new-world-record-net-entertainments-slot-game-mega-fortune-pays-out-17-8-meur/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NetEnt&#39;s official site</a>.  <br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><font face="roboto condensed" size="5">#2 - Microgaming’s Mega Moolah - €17,879,645.12</font></span></p>

<p>This one is that kind of story that proves that good deeds get rewarded. The €17,879,645.12 jackpot was won by the British soldier Jon Heywood, who bet 25 pennies in the online casino called Betway. The man, who served in Afghanistan, didn’t realize what had happened to him at first - he stated that he didn’t actually acknowledge what happened to him for the first 3 days. <br />
<br />
As for how he planned to spend his fortune, his approach sparked public sympathy, as he planned to get the best treatment for his father, who needed a heart and lung transplant. In addition, he said that he will not get carried away by the money, but he wants to switch his Fiat Punto for a Bentley Continental GT - quite a switch, we can say. If you would like to hear the complete story, check it out on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34496035/soldier-wins-132m-after-gambling-25p-online" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BBC&#39;s website</a>. The Guinness World Record registered for this event can be found on the dedicated page of the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-jackpot-payout-in-an-online-slot-machine-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Guinness official website</a>. <br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><font face="roboto condensed" size="5">#1 - Microgaming’s Mega Moolah</font></span></p>

<p>We didn’t want to spoil the fact that the 1st and the 2nd  place are occupied by the same game, from the same company. And these last two stories share another interesting detail - this jackpot was won with a 75 cents bet. The winner who struck it lucky in September 2018 was playing at Grand Mondial Casino on an Android device and wanted to remain anonymous. <br />
<br />
So far, this is the highest the progressive jackpots went in the history of online gaming, setting a new world record. The good thing is that Microgaming is not settling for a competition just with NetEnt, but its aim seems to be to always surpass itself. We can’t wait to see that will the future bring on this company’s side.     <br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><font face="roboto condensed" size="5">Mega Moolah</font></span></p>

<p>It’s not wrong to state that Mega Moolah is one of the best paying slots games in the history of online gambling. As you saw above, this game alone made 68 millionaires around the world and holds the record for the biggest jackpot. The game itself is a progressive jackpot slot game, which will take you on a wild Africa universe through its thematic elements. <br />
<br />
Mega Moolah offers multiple opportunities for rewards in an innovative and unique combination of 5 reels and 25 pay-lines plus a Wheel of Fortune style jackpot game. But the best way to get a grasp of the game is to try it - you can <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/play/mega-moolah">play Mega Moolah here</a> on CasinosLists.com, along with a list of online casinos for real money that provide this game. <br />

<p><br />
Mega Fortune is the competition for the Microgaming title presented above. Using the same progressive payout system, the NetEnt game is played across 5 reels and 25 paylines, providing a glimpse of luxury and wealth through its esthetic elements - yachts, limousines and champagne toasts. Mega Fortune slot offers a couple of different features that make the entire gameplay more interesting, however, by far the most interesting feature are the 3 different progressive jackpots: Mega Jackpot, Major Jackpot and Rapid Jackpot. The counters for all 3 of these are displayed just above the reels. <br />
