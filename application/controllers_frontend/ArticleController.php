    'description' => '<p style="text-align: justify;">We see them on TV and we see them all over the Internet too. They have millions of followers and fans, but celebrities are just like us in so many ways. As a hobby beside their gigs and jobs, many of them have a thing for gambling, even if it involves donating the wins to a charity or just playing for fun.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Down below, we at CasinosLists.com have made a selection of five famous people that love gambling, casinos, and everything else that comes with them.</p>

<center><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>5. PRINCE HARRY</strong></span></center>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Prince Harry gambling" height="499" heightcpy="499" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_11111.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 499px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="333" widthcpy="333" /></p>

<p>Harry loves Las Vegas, and his 2011 vacation at the Wynn Resort and Casino stands as proof. While he was there, he had the whole place booked the whole place for himself and his friends and bodyguards, so the entire gang can enjoy a fun weekend together. The bill turned out to be no less than $30,000 and it included <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/craps">craps games</a> and many cocktails. Of course, it was paid by Steve Wynn, the owner, as he couldn’t let Prince Harry spend a penny. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“You&#39;ve got to have fun in life. Otherwise, wow - imagine life without fun.” - Prince Harry</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>4. FLOYD MAYWEATHER JUNIOR</strong></span></p>

<center>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="FLOYD MAYWEATHER JUNIOR gambling" height="499" heightcpy="499" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_4444.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 499px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="333" widthcpy="333" /></p>
</center>

<p>When it comes to boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr., it is rumoured that his bets can get to $100,000 per hand, and his social media photos showing his wins are proof of that. He is especially a sports betting fan and his bets usually range from $25,000 to even $400,000 on some events. Let’s also not forget that Floyd is the one 50 Cent once put a bet on, and we will get to that as well in a few minutes. However, this is understandable, as Floyd, who came out as a winner and thus earned the rapper a handsome prize, once said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“I land a higher percentage of punches than any boxer in boxing.” - Floyd Mayweather Jr.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>3. PARIS HILTON</strong></span></p>

<center>
<p><img alt="Paris Hilton gambling" height="499" heightcpy="499" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_5555.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 499px;" width="333" widthcpy="333" /></p>
</center>

<p>It all started when Paris was paid £100,000 for being a DJ at the start of the 2000s somewhere in Vegas. She managed to bet and turn this fee into half a million dollars, but she lost the lot a few hours later. However, her heart remained in Vegas, and in 2012 she tweeted a picture of a $30,000 win on her birthday. Of course, we will never know about the other wins she isn’t sharing on social media. In the hotel heiress’ own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em> “I&#39;m obsessed with poker. It&#39;s my favorite game now. I&#39;m lucky in Vegas. I always win.” - Paris Hilton</em></p>
</blockquote>

<center><strong>2. MICHAEL JORDAN</strong>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Michael Jordan gambling" height="500" heightcpy="500" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_222.jpg" style="width: 393px; height: 500px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="393" widthcpy="393" /></p>
</center>

<p>The six-time NBA champion just loves wagering, even when it involves losing sometimes. However, Michael Jordan has a really vast history with gambling for fun, and his two sons as well. For Michael Jordan it is all about sports betting, as the competitiveness in the basketball world has made him all he is today. According to the reports, Michael has once bet $300,000 on a hole in one for a golf match.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Gambling is legal and betting is legal, for what I bet.”  - Michael Jordan</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>1. 50 CENT</strong></span><br />
<img alt="50 cent gambling" height="500" heightcpy="500" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_3333.jpg" style="width: 332px; height: 500px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="332" widthcpy="332" /></p>

<p>50 Cent’s passion for sports betting is already well-known, as he once placed a $2 million bet on Floyd Mayweather at a boxing championship. He showed all of his followers how a $500,000 win in cash looks like when he wagered at the NFC Championship, a classic and completely understandable winner move in our book. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em> " That wasn&#39;t gambling, because Floyd don&#39;t lose." - 50 Cent</em></p>
