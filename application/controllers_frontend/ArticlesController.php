	<li><strong>SkillOnNet is behind many successful online casino brands</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A new chapter begins for Slingo.com</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Founded in 1994, Slingo.com will now be marketed and operated by SkillOnNet operator Prime Gaming, the brain behind ICE36.com and MegaCasino.com.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“With the coming together of SkillOnNet, Gaming Realms, and Prime Gaming, it feels like we’re putting together an online gaming supergroup,” said Michael Golembo of SkillOnNet.</span><br />
<br />
Gaming Realms, Slingo’s parent company, has launched some of the most well-known products into the gambling market, such as Slingo Rainbow Riches, Slingo Extreme, and Slingo XXXTreme.<br />
<img alt="Slingo logo partnership SKillOnNet Wazdan online casino gaming slots" height="385" heightcpy="385" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Slingo-lg.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="850" widthcpy="850" /><br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What’s the actual deal between SkillOnNet and Slingo.com?</strong></span><br />
The collaboration SkillOnNet and Slingo.com will give users 3,000 new games to choose from, all from some of the top-rated developers in the online casino industry. No original games will disappear from the official Slingo website. There will only be additional ones that will bring more and more players to the Slingo platform.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“SkillOnNet is behind some of the most successful online casino brands in the world and we wanted to leverage its technology and experience to drive Slingo.com forwards,” said Mark Segal, CFO of Gaming Realms.</span><br />
<br />
Licensing offered by SkillOnNet will help Slingo operate in more countries and get its brand known by many more people across the globe. <br />
<br />
SkillOnNet has the intention of providing more and more casino products to gambling enthusiasts out there. Recently, its partnership with Wazdan was a real success, as this was a good way to provide more for passionate gamblers.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“It&#39;s a pleasure to partner with SkillOnNet and release Wazdan games through their brands, including <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/reviews/playojo-casino-review">PlayOJO</a>, SlotsMagic, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/reviews/drueckglueck-casino-review">DrueckGlueck</a> and more. This relationship further expands the reach of our games across the European market,” said Andrzej Hyla, Head of Sales at Wazdan.</span><br />
<br />
This proves the SkillOnNet team’s dedication and good reputation in the online casino gaming industry as the company makes a name for itself by helping smaller providers reach bigger audiences. There surely are many other providers SkillOnNet would like to collaborate with, and users surely can&#39;t wait for the next partnership that is to come!</p>

	<li><strong>You will be rewarded with Free Spins often thanks to the slot’s design</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The 5 reels and 3 rows <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/video-slots">video slot</a> is waiting for you with its amazing graphics and animations, along with extra features and bonuses that we will discuss below.<br />
<img alt="Red Tiger Gaming Launches New Leprechaun\'s Magic Slot" height="780" heightcpy="780" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Leprechaun_s_Magic_Red_Tiger_Gaming.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1308" widthcpy="1308" /><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>A New Adventure Awaits!</strong></span><br />
As illustrated by the images attached above and below, the Leprechaun’s Magic new online slot for 20202 released by Red Tiger Gaming evokes an atmosphere that is particularly jolly and pleasant. You’ll find yourself in the mood to gamble for real money in no time!<br />
<br />
With 10 paylines and an RTP of 95.95%, Red Tiger Gaming’s Leprechaun’s Magic is a penny slot suitable for novices and high rollers alike, as the minimum bet amount is 0.20 EUR and it can get to 10 EUR. All these will surely appeal to the fans of the genre itself, but this slot can surely be played by any passionate player.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>More on Leprechaun’s Magic</strong></span><br />
A well-known theme, the Irish green interface is one that has been used by many slots up to date. However, it can still hit differently depending on the game’s overall design. For fans of the genre, the theme can be a big advantage, and Leprechaun’s Magic is no exception. Even if this concept has been used by many others before it, Red Tiger Gaming managed to revive it and create an entirely special online casino game.<br />
<img alt="Red Tiger Gaming Launches New Leprechaun\'s Magic Slot gameplay irish online casino game new " height="416" heightcpy="416" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Leprechaun_s_Magic_slot.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="740" widthcpy="740" />Leprechaun’s Magic is all about its mighty wins of 5,000 times the stake with one single spin. The Expanding Symbols appear in both bonus and base gameplays. When there is a win, the winning symbol will light up and create a Golden Symbol. If there are 3 or more Golden Symbols these will expand and cover the entire reel, which in turn will generate the winning lines.<br />
<br />
The Magic Spins Free Spins feature will trigger once Pot of Gold scatter symbols appear, with at least 3 in view triggering a spin on the Magic Wheel. During normal base game spins, Golden Symbols only last one spin. <br />
<br />
We are sure players will enjoy this game, thanks to everything it has to offer. The free spins and bonuses are really lucrative and all of the visual effects are on point, which recommends Leprechaun’s Magic as another success from Red Tiger Gaming!</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>China has canceled many passports due to fraudulent betting</strong></li>
	<li><strong>As illegal gambling took over China, the crime rates rose significantly</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Chinese and Philippine Governments stood together against illegal betting</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="China Philippine gambling ban" height="512" heightcpy="512" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/China_Philippines.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1024" widthcpy="1024" /><span style="font-size:16px;">"We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary," declared Mr. Martini Cruz, chief of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation’s cybercrime division.</span><br />
<br />
However, the restrictions have not targeted proxy betting, which is allowed in licensed casinos in the Philippines and contributed to a significant rise in VIP revenues. <br />
<br />
Proxy betting implies a gambler outside the casino giving instructions to an agent via an online platform. This allows people to bet anonymously and even illegally.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>The Legal Status of Gambling in China </strong></span><br />
In theory, gambling is illegal according to Chinese law since the Communist Party took power back in 1949. This prohibits all forms of gambling, online or otherwise, but people do have access to land-based gambling in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="color:#e74c3c;">“80% of the business comes from <strong>proxy gambling</strong> and 20% from customers visiting casinos for live table games.”</span></span><br />
<br />
The Chinese government operates the Welfare and Sports Lotteries, which are not considered gambling. However, in Hong Kong, many forms of iGaming are regulated. <br />
<br />
When it comes to Macau, casino games have been legal since the 1850s, as it once was a Portuguese colony. The region is known for the presence of traditional Chinese games in casinos.<br />
<br />
Even though proxy betting is banned in Singapore and Macau, there is a gray legal area in the Philippines. According to leading junket operator Suncity, 80% of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20% from customers visiting casinos for live table games.<br />
<br />
Manila and Hong Kong now fight against illegal gambling in all forms, as Xi Jinping of China and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines join forces against these types of actions. The Philippine president has even gone as far as to make illegal gambling the third worst crime in the country after drugs and corruption.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What the Situation Looks Like</strong></span><br />
After Philippine authorities arrested 342 Chinese workers in December 2019 in a raid on an unlicensed and illegal gambling operation, it is now time for them to join China in this fight against illegal and fraudulent betting. <br />
<img alt="China Philippine gambling ban proxy betting" height="1326" heightcpy="1326" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/China_Philippines_Gambling.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1999" widthcpy="1999" />The situation generated more crimes in China, but the Chinese Embassy said that it “works closely with the Philippines to combat such crimes as telecommunications fraud, illegal online gambling, money laundering, illegal employment, kidnapping, extortion, torture, murder”.<br />
<br />
In 2019, Beijing canceled 800 Chinese passports. This made the people “fugitive” which led to them being arrested by the Philippine authorities.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>More Restrictions Are Coming</strong></span><br />
Even if the authorities are already making visible efforts, it is obvious that the operation has just begun and that it won’t stop until this gambling problem is solved. <br />
<br />
As long as the Chinese and Philippine Governments are trying to combat this type of crime, there is hope that one day people will gamble legally in a safe and licensed environment that abides by each countries’ regulations. <br />
<br />
These illegal betting methods are not safe, nor are they rewarding in any case, and they are also making room for many other criminal actions which the Chinese and Philippine governments want to keep under control.</p>

    'description' => '<p>There are many online casino banking methods to choose from in the online gambling industry. You can rely on your bank via debit cards or a wire transfer, or you can try an intermediate software for quicker transactions and some additional layers of security. It is all up to you! Below, we here at CasinosLists.com have made a selection of the 7 most well-known and player-appreciated online casino payment methods for you to choose from. <br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>7. WIRE TRANSFER</strong></span><br />
The simplest method of transferring a certain amount of money from one bank to another, the <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/banking/wire-transfer">wire bank transfer</a> is available for both online casino deposits and withdrawals. It is one of the oldest and most reliable payment options for gambling, as it does not imply any additional intermediates. The only big downside is the effort on your part in terms of obtaining the bank details of the online casino. What is more, wire transfer can also be quite expensive in some countries due to fees charged by both parties involved. <br />
<br />
Therefore, before pursuing a wire bank transfer, you need to ensure that you are well informed on the topic. Still, once you have the details you need, it is a fairly hassle-free procedure, so it might be worth trying out.<br />

    'description' => '<p>Online casino companies operating in Spain are obligated to change their welcome bonus policy, as Spain is facing a problematic situation right now. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Spanish Government decided that welcome bonuses will have a maximum value of €100</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The matter also addresses the underage gambling problem in Spain</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Online gambling lacks sufficient identity validation compared to land-based facilities</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Spain welcome bonuses online casinos" height="664" heightcpy="664" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Spain_Country-min.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1000" widthcpy="1000" />The aforementioned mandatory policy changes come with a growing intention on the part of Spanish officials to decrease illegal gambling rates, especially among underage and chronically-ill players. These new restrictions will be part of the <strong>Royal Decree Project</strong>, which focuses on how gambling companies are allowed to market their products to the general public.<br />
<br />
While welcome bonuses are not necessarily problematic in their nature, the whole situation degenerated when underaged gamblers made use of them in order to play illegally and for free.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>The Latest Rules Implemented In Spain</strong></span><br />
The Spanish Government has decided to stop underage gambling in the country after observing that many minors abused the demo feature of welcome bonuses, thus resulting in illegal gambling. This means that new restrictions are coming in order for the law to be respected by that particular group of players that should not be gambling in the first place.<br />
<br />
Jdigital, Spanish’s dedicated authority that deals with online gambling, mentioned that last month its members started imposing the new voluntary advertising code that limits welcome bonuses to €200. This, of course, does not include the amount players can obtain through ads or other kinds of offers that also stack with the initial money. <br />
<br />
Therefore, this method did not work as it should and players continued making significant wins by playing for free. <br />
<img alt="Spain welcome bonuses" height="300" heightcpy="300" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/Welcome_Bonus.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="600" widthcpy="600" />Problem gambling is rumoured to be a big issue in Spain, as there is a high-rate of underage players. However, the official statistics for problem gamblers is somewhere around 0.4%. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">“Police forces do not relate any major social problems to gambling in the region.” - Javier Molinera, head of National Police Gaming and Betting Control Service.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What About the Spanish Government?</strong></span><br />
The government announced EFICAZ, the operational system meant to limit problematic and addicted gamblers from accessing various forms of financing to play. This was designed as a self-exclusion program.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">Alberto Garzón, Spain’s Minister of Consumer Affairs, declared that the type of customers attracted by online casinos had “proved to be controversial”, especially due to “expanding the number of users and amounts played”.</span><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the mentioned statistics also involve minors and gambling addicts, which are exactly the type of at-risk categories who need to stop playing casino games.<br />
<br />
This may be the main reason these restrictions needed to be applied,  namely to protect the people who need it the most. Another beneficial side effect for the online gambling industry would be to prevent excessive playing with free money.<br />
<br />
In other words, Spain has come to the right decision, helping its citizens along the way and shedding light on a problem that may happen to anyone. Considering the <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/news/the-united-kingdom-prohibited-credit-cards-for-online-gambling">regulations imposed in the United Kingdom regarding credit cards</a>, it is clear that there may be many other countries that face the problem of fraudulent gambling, as sometimes people abuse bonuses and advantages.<br />
<br />
As a conclusion, the government and specialists in Spain have restricted welcome bonuses in online casinos to €100, so that users will be able to benefit from some free money but also gamble with their own. </p>

	<li><strong>22% of gamblers using credit cards are classified as “problematic” in the UK</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Authorities speak of gambling addiction as of a mental health crisis</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Some gamblers from the UK are in substantial debt, placing bets of £380,000 per session</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to industry regulators, using a credit card as a payment method for online casinos in the United Kingdom will be banned due at the suggestion of <strong>The Department of Culture</strong>, <strong>Media</strong>, <strong>and</strong> <strong>Sport (DCMS)</strong>. All gambling in the UK will be all affected by this ban, except for the <strong>National</strong> <strong>Lottery</strong>.<br />
<br />
The restriction will come into effect starting with the 14th of April. This has been decided due to the fact that many people are gambling with money they don’t have, resulting in the country’s national economy being affected.<br />
<img alt="UK gambling credit cards ban big ben london" height="334" heightcpy="334" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/ukk.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="500" widthcpy="500" /><span style="font-size:16px;">“Credit Card gambling can lead to significant financial harm”, says Neil McArthur, Gambling Commission chief executive.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Gamblers in the United Kingdom Are in Debt</strong></span><br />
The United Kingdom wants to protect its citizens, especially those who suffer from an online gambling addiction. The <strong>DCMS</strong>, along with <strong>The UK Gambling Commission’s Betting and Gaming Council</strong>, and other relevant authorities have come upon the decision to restrict credit cards, e-wallets, PayPal, and other similar payment methods. <br />
<br />
Statistics show that more than a quarter of online gamblers using a credit card has had a serious online casino addiction problem at least once. In fact, <strong>around 800,000 gamblers use credit cards, and 22% of them are classified as “problem gamblers”</strong> who are prone to developing addictive behaviors.<br />
<br />
Last year, The Guardian reported the case of an addicted gambler who has used nine different credit cards for online gambling and ended up with a <strong>£54,000</strong> overnight loss. Her total bets got to <strong>£380,000</strong> on one website in a single session.<br />
<br />
Gambling enthusiasts will thus be allowed to use debit cards only but with the condition to get a membership for GamStop. GamStop allows gamblers to block their accounts and funds with ease in the case of addictive gambling, and won’t let them open new accounts due to the use of pseudonym recognition technology.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;">Claire Murdoch, <strong>National Mental Health Director</strong> with <strong>NHS England</strong>, said “I have seen first-hand the devastating impact on mental wellbeing of addiction and am concerned that the prevalence of gambling in our society is causing harm”, implying that addiction is clearly linked to one’s mental health.</span><br />
<img alt="UK credit card ban casino " height="334" heightcpy="334" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/uk.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="500" widthcpy="500" /><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Other Payment Methods Will Be Restricted Too</strong></span><br />
Brigid Simmonds, the chairwoman of the <strong>Betting and Gaming Council</strong> said that "We will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk”, which means that the Council’s efforts will potentially discover a more suitable way to help those affected by addiction control their habits more successfully.<br />

    'description' => '<p style="text-align: justify;">We see them on TV and we see them all over the Internet too. They have millions of followers and fans, but celebrities are just like us in so many ways. As a hobby beside their gigs and jobs, many of them have a thing for gambling, even if it involves donating the wins to a charity or just playing for fun.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Down below, we at CasinosLists.com have made a selection of five famous people that love gambling, casinos, and everything else that comes with them.</p>

<center><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>5. PRINCE HARRY</strong></span></center>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Prince Harry gambling" height="499" heightcpy="499" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_11111.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 499px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="333" widthcpy="333" /></p>

<p>Harry loves Las Vegas, and his 2011 vacation at the Wynn Resort and Casino stands as proof. While he was there, he had the whole place booked the whole place for himself and his friends and bodyguards, so the entire gang can enjoy a fun weekend together. The bill turned out to be no less than $30,000 and it included <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/craps">craps games</a> and many cocktails. Of course, it was paid by Steve Wynn, the owner, as he couldn’t let Prince Harry spend a penny. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“You&#39;ve got to have fun in life. Otherwise, wow - imagine life without fun.” - Prince Harry</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>4. FLOYD MAYWEATHER JUNIOR</strong></span></p>

<center>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="FLOYD MAYWEATHER JUNIOR gambling" height="499" heightcpy="499" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_4444.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 499px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="333" widthcpy="333" /></p>
</center>

<p>When it comes to boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr., it is rumoured that his bets can get to $100,000 per hand, and his social media photos showing his wins are proof of that. He is especially a sports betting fan and his bets usually range from $25,000 to even $400,000 on some events. Let’s also not forget that Floyd is the one 50 Cent once put a bet on, and we will get to that as well in a few minutes. However, this is understandable, as Floyd, who came out as a winner and thus earned the rapper a handsome prize, once said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“I land a higher percentage of punches than any boxer in boxing.” - Floyd Mayweather Jr.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>3. PARIS HILTON</strong></span></p>

<center>
<p><img alt="Paris Hilton gambling" height="499" heightcpy="499" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/rsz_5555.jpg" style="width: 333px; height: 499px;" width="333" widthcpy="333" /></p>
</center>

<p>It all started when Paris was paid £100,000 for being a DJ at the start of the 2000s somewhere in Vegas. She managed to bet and turn this fee into half a million dollars, but she lost the lot a few hours later. However, her heart remained in Vegas, and in 2012 she tweeted a picture of a $30,000 win on her birthday. Of course, we will never know about the other wins she isn’t sharing on social media. In the hotel heiress’ own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em> “I&#39;m obsessed with poker. It&#39;s my favorite game now. I&#39;m lucky in Vegas. I always win.” - Paris Hilton</em></p>
</blockquote>

</center>

<p>The six-time NBA champion just loves wagering, even when it involves losing sometimes. However, Michael Jordan has a really vast history with gambling for fun, and his two sons as well. For Michael Jordan it is all about sports betting, as the competitiveness in the basketball world has made him all he is today. According to the reports, Michael has once bet $300,000 on a hole in one for a golf match.</p>

<p>50 Cent’s passion for sports betting is already well-known, as he once placed a $2 million bet on Floyd Mayweather at a boxing championship. He showed all of his followers how a $500,000 win in cash looks like when he wagered at the NFC Championship, a classic and completely understandable winner move in our book. </p>

<p>After land based casinos came the online ones that allow us to play anywhere, even from a <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/casinos/mobile">mobile</a> device. As technology progresses and our visions change, we all start craving new experiences along with high quality graphics, exciting new concepts, and state of the art features. So, what if we told you that you can now achieve a first-person casino experience in your own home? <br />
<br />
This is where virtual reality comes in. As a history lesson, it all started in Renaissance Europe, where the term of <strong>perspective</strong> was created, meant to define a concept of “multiplying” the “artificial world”. The idea of virtual reality started circulating shortly thereafter, especially in SF novels and movies. However, VR took its official start with Sensorama, the first version of a VR set created in 1962 by Morton Heilig. <br />
<br />
But how does this apply to gambling? Well, if you ever heard about VR online casinos, you may be familiar with the subject. It all boils down to a <strong>virtual</strong> <strong>reality</strong> <strong>kit</strong> that helps you engage with a land based casino with only a few technical requirements on your part. Keep reading to find out more!<br />
<img alt="VR casinos virtual reality vr set casino slots roulette baccarat blackjack virtual reality oculus" height="667" heightcpy="667" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/image3.png" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1000" widthcpy="1000" /></p>

<p><span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>ABOUT VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) </strong></span></span><br />
Virtual reality, or VR for short, is a simulated experience based on the real world meant to digitally transport you to a certain place, film, or even game. It consists of computer-made 360° pictures, places, and videos or even 360° landscapes of real places, depending on what you choose to do. The ability to interact with different objects in VR is the result of multi-projected technologies used to create the images, sensations, and sounds. <br />
<br />
When it comes to virtual reality in the online casinos world, the results of this technology are the ability to spin <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/classic-slots">slots</a> or bet at <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/blackjack">blackjack</a>, which can all be done with VR equipment such as headsets and sometimes even motion controllers. The latter are a pair of devices you hold in your hand in order to interact with the virtual world you are in. These recognize your hand movements and help you feel the whole experience on another level.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>THE FIRST VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) CASINO</strong></span></span><br />
The first virtual reality casino to launch in the industry was <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/reviews/slotsmillion-casino-review">SlotsMillion</a> and, to this day, it is the number one in its area of operation. Inspired by video games, a Malta-based company by the name of ALEA Gaming started the project for SlotsMillion in 2015, and launched it two years later, in 2017. <br />
<br />
The famed casino now offers more than 1,100 <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/games/classic-slots">slot machines</a> and is known for making the first ever virtual reality casino games available on the market, and thus offering its clients the experience of playing at a real land-based casino. At SlotsMillion, you will find hi-tech games under the brand of some famous names such as <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/netent">NetEnt</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/betsoft">BetSoft</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/blueprint-gaming">Blueprint Gaming</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/saucify">Saucify</a>, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/nextgen-gaming">NextGen Gaming</a>, along with many more. <img alt="SlotsMillion vr online casino virtual reality slots blackjack roulette" height="720" heightcpy="720" src="https://www.casinoslists.com/upload/tms/image2.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="1200" widthcpy="1200" />Thanks to SlotsMillion’s ascent, today it is one of the most accessed and played online casinos, thanks to its quality and what it offers. Of course, there is also the fun branch: Oculus’ VR Casino, a social gaming concept that can not be played for real money. As presented below, here you will find online casino games that can be played with free credits, solo or multiplayer. The idea is based on entertainment only and it is dedicated to people who don’t necessarily want to gamble on VR yet, as this will help anyone get used to it and form an idea of what these casinos are all about.</p>

<p><span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>MOBILE COMPATIBILITY</strong></span></span><br />
VR had a blast on mobile in its first years, as Samsung devices could be connected to Oculus and with the help of your smartphone you could enjoy a simulated reality with the help of the corresponding headsets. When Samsung S7 was released, the first orders came with a pair of Oculus glasses with which many games could be played. Today, many online casinos support <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/casinos/mobile">mobile</a> phones when it comes to VR gameplay.  Also, with a smart TV or a compatible Playstation you can find and improvise many ways to play online casino games in VR. It is all up to you and your ideas!<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#4e5f70;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS</strong></span></span><br />
VR was a science-fiction term until recently, just like FaceTime seemed impossible to have at your own comfort at the start of the 2000s. Today, VR is just another way to play games or watch movies, as we just started the new decade with a huge boom in terms of technology and discoveries. The virtual reality experience is worth trying, especially in online casinos, as it will offer you a totally different feeling than a classic computer or mobile device. Virtual reality casinos are growing in number, as SlotsMillion created a legacy and an evolution in its own niche. Thus, the whole VR casino concept is worth trying, as it is evolving everyday in order to give you the best and most rewarding gameplay out there!</p>

A special feature of The Goldfather slot is the rewarding system, which means that if you claim machine guns as you play, the game will give you 250 coins. Meeting mob bosses will payout 750 coins, while meeting the Godfather will offer 1,000 coins, as every meet is triggered by different symbols that may trigger movie scenes. Even more bonuses can be activated with the <strong>Wild</strong> <strong>Red</strong> <strong>Roses</strong> and <strong>Bonus</strong> <strong>Wedding</strong> <strong>Cakes</strong> symbols.

<p><strong>1. THE MUMMY (PLAYTECH)<br />
Date of release:</strong> 15 June 2012<br />
<br />
Yet another <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/softwares/playtech">Playtech</a> Flash product, <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/play/the-mummy-by-playtech">The Mummy</a> may be one of the developer’s biggest successes, just like the movie it takes inspiration from. This slot’s main feature consists of the <strong>Lost City Adventure Bonus</strong> which is activated randomly. A part of the movie will start playing as you are taken to a secret room in the Lost City. You will then have the possibility to pick 6 crates and reveal their prizes which can reach up to 4x your total stake. <br />
<br />
Other attributes of The Mummy that put it in the first position on our top consist of the <strong>Scorpion</strong> <strong>Scatter</strong>, which transforms into an extra scatter, thus giving you more money, and the <strong>Expanding</strong> <strong>Mummy</strong> that turns into an <strong>Expanding</strong> <strong>Wild</strong> in order to cover an entire reel once a wild appears. There is also the <strong>Scarab</strong> <strong>Attack</strong> feature which is activated if wild symbols show on the third reel, and once this occurs you will get two more wilds on reels 2 and 4. With <strong>Mummy</strong> <strong>Power</strong>, each wild multiplies the bet per line by 3 and this feature stacks best with multiple wilds. During <strong>Collapsing</strong> <strong>Reels</strong>, lucky symbols disappear in order to be replaced by new ones over and over, and there is also the <strong>Mummy</strong> <strong>Respin</strong>, where a wild will cause the reel to freeze while the other spin a few more times until a win is triggered.<br />
<br />
The Mummy slot machine by Playtech features a RTP of 92.02% and a minimum bet of 1.25, so that means that it suits experienced players and that you should try it for fun on our website before deciding to gamble at a <a href="https://www.casinoslists.com/casinos">real money casino</a>. As any Playtech product, The Mummy should work fine on any mobile device, though it is not mentioned.<br />
